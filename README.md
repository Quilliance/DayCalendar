<h1 align="center">JavaScript Day Calendar</h1>
<p>
Small HTML widget for displaying a daily schedule.
</p>
<p>
Example use cases are:
</p>

- Displaying a schedule of a resources (e.g. conference room) for a single day.
- Showing events for the upcoming day in a small portion of a user dashboard.

<p>
The latter was the initial use case for this. We built the day calendar to show a user's upcoming events for the day in his Digital Workplace.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The calendar is written in JavaScript and draws all information in SVG.
